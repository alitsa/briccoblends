  <h2>Environmental &amp; Economic Impact</h2>

<p><strong>Hello, Litsa here!</strong> I founded Bricco Blends in 2020 to help small coffee shop owners like myself. I spent a year developing a recipe that would taste delicious, foam gorgeously, and take the effort out of making house-made oat milk. I'm so excited about the impact Bricco Blends can have on the environment and local economy:</p>

<ol>
<li><h3>Help the environment</h3>
<p>The average coffee shop currently throws 6,240 Tetra Paks in the landfill every year! Bricco Blends uses compostable packaging</p></li>

<li><h3>Help tiny shops</h3>
<p>One bag of Bricco Blends uses 1/6 the storage space as a 12-quart case of barista oat milk. This is so helpful for small shops and coffee trailers!</p>
</li>

<li><h3>Promote local business</h3>
<p>Neighborhood coffee shops can differentiate their business by using fresh, house made oat milk. Bottled oat milk can be sold along side a shop's specialty coffee blends.
Coffee shops can become destinations for conscientious consumers who want to buy organic, locally made oat milk.</p></li>
